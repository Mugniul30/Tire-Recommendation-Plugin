2. Users will enter their vehicle registration and postcode to get a list of recommended tires based on their details.

== Google Sheets Implementation ==

This plugin fetches tire recommendation data from a Google Sheet. Below are the steps to set up the **Google Sheet** and connect it to the plugin:

### 1. Create a Google Sheets Spreadsheet

The plugin uses Google Sheets as a data source. To set it up:

1. **Create a new Google Sheets document**.
2. **Create the following columns in the first row**:
   - **Registration Number**: The vehicle's registration number (e.g., "ABC1234").
   - **Postcode**: The vehicle owner's postcode (e.g., "12345").
   - **Tire Sizes**: A comma-separated list of tire sizes (e.g., "205/55R16, 215/60R16").
   - **Brands**: A comma-separated list of tire brands (e.g., "Michelin, Goodyear").

   Example:
   | Registration Number | Postcode | Tire Sizes         | Brands            |
   |---------------------|----------|--------------------|-------------------|
   | ABC1234             | 12345    | 205/55R16, 215/60R16 | Michelin, Goodyear |
   | XYZ5678             | 67890    | 195/65R15, 205/55R16 | Pirelli, Bridgestone |

3. **Share the Google Sheet**:
   - Make sure the **Google Sheet is publicly accessible** to anyone with the link. This is essential for the plugin to fetch data.
   - You can do this by clicking the **Share** button on the Google Sheet and selecting **"Anyone with the link can view"**.

### 2. Obtain Google API Credentials

The plugin uses the **Google Sheets API** to fetch data. Follow these steps to obtain the credentials:

1. Go to the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. **Create a new project** (e.g., "Tire Recommendation Plugin").
3. **Enable the Google Sheets API**:
   - In the **APIs & Services > Library**, search for "Google Sheets API" and enable it for your project.
4. **Create Service Account Credentials**:
   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials** and click on **Create Credentials**.
   - Select **Service Account** and follow the prompts.
   - After creating the service account, download the **JSON file** with your credentials.
   - **Rename the file** to `credentials.json` and place it in your pluginâ€™s root directory.
5. **Update the `GoogleSheets` class**:
   - In the `includes/class-trs-google-sheets.php` file, the plugin reads the `credentials.json` file to authenticate with the Google Sheets API:
   
     ```php
     $client->setAuthConfig(TRS_PLUGIN_DIR . '/credentials.json');
     ```

   Ensure this path is correct, and that the `credentials.json` file is in the plugin directory.

### 3. Set Up the Google Sheet Data

Once your Google Sheets API is connected and the plugin is set up:

- Add tire recommendations to the Google Sheets document. Ensure that each entry contains the vehicle registration number, postcode, tire sizes, and brands.
- You can add as many rows as necessary to store tire recommendations for different vehicles and postcodes.

### 4. Configuring the Plugin

1. The **Google Sheet ID** and **sheet range** are set in the plugin file `includes/class-trs-google-sheets.php`:
   - **Sheet ID**: The unique ID of the Google Sheet (found in the URL).
   - **Sheet Range**: The range to query (e.g., `Sheet1!A:D`).

2. **Test the integration** by entering a **vehicle registration number** and **postcode** on the frontend form. The plugin will retrieve the corresponding tire sizes and brands and display them as WooCommerce products.

== FAQ ==

= How do I add my own vehicle data? =
